# Code of Conduct and Community Citizenship

## Purpose

In the interest of fostering an open and welcoming environment inclusive to all
contributors from varied and diverse backgrounds, we as contributors and
maintainers pledge to making participation in our project and our community a
harassment-free experience by providing a friendly, safe and welcoming
environment for everyone regardless of: ability, age, body size, ethnicity,
gender identity and expression, level of experience, education, socio-economic
status, nationality, personal appearance, race, religion (or lack thereof), or
sexual identity and orientation.

This code of conduct outlines our expectations for all those who participate in
our community, as well as the consequences for unacceptable behavior - we invite
all those who participate to help us create safe and positive experiences for
everyone.

## Open Citizenship

A supplemental goal of this Code of Conduct is to increase open citizenship by
encouraging participants to recognize and strengthen the relationships between
our actions and their effects on our community.

Communities mirror the societies in which they exist and positive action is
essential to counteract the many forms of inequality and abuses of power that
exist in society.

If you see someone who is making an extra effort to ensure our community is
welcoming, friendly, and encourages all participants to contribute to the
fullest extent, we want to know.

## Expected Behavior

The following behaviors are expected and requested of all community members, to
contribute towards creating a positive environment:

- Participate in an authentic and active way, showing empathy towards other
  community members and the wider public. In doing so, you contribute to the
  health and longevity of this community.
- Using welcoming and inclusive language, exercising consideration and respect
  in your speech and actions.
- Being respectful of differing viewpoints and experiences
- Gracefully accepting constructive criticism
- Focusing on what is best for the community
- Attempt collaboration before conflict.
- Refrain from demeaning, discriminatory, or harassing behavior and speech.
- Be mindful of your surroundings and of your fellow participants. Alert
  community leaders if you notice a dangerous situation, someone in distress,
  or violations of this Code of Conduct, even if they seem inconsequential.
- Remember that community event venues may be shared with members of the
  public; please be respectful to all patrons of these locations.

## Unacceptable Behavior

The following behaviors are considered harassment and are unacceptable within
our community:

- Violence, threats of violence or violent language directed against another
  person.
- Sexist, racist, homophobic, transphobic, ableist or otherwise discriminatory
  jokes, language or imagery.
- Posting or displaying sexually explicit or violent material
- Posting/publishing or threatening to post/publish other people's personally
  identifying information ("doxing") whether physical or electronic.
- Personal or politcal attacks (including insulting or derogatory comments);
  particularly those related to gender, sexual orientation, race, religion, or
  disability.
- Inappropriate photography or recording.
- Inappropriate physical contact. You should have someone's consent before
  touching them.
- The use of sexualised language or imagery and unwelcome sexual attention or
  advances; this includes sexualised comments or jokes, inappropriate touching
  and/or groping.
- Deliberate intimidation, stalking or following (online or in person).
- Advocating for, or encouraging, any of the above behavior.
- Sustained disruption of community events, including talks and presentations.
- Other conduct which could reasonably be considered inappropriate in a
  professional setting
  
This list is not exhaustive and will be appropriately expanded upon in the
future should circumstances, experiences, events or behaviours prompt such
action to be taken. 

### Apologising for Mistakes

Should you catch yourself behaving disrespectfully, or be confronted as such,
own up to your words and actions, and apologize accordingly. No one is perfect,
and even well-intentioned people make mistakes - especially since different
people have different lived experiences. What matters is how you handle them,
and avoiding repeating them in the future.

## Our Responsibilities

Community leaders are responsible for clarifying the standards of acceptable
behavior and are expected to take appropriate and fair corrective action in
response to any instances of unacceptable behavior.

Community leaders have the right and responsibility to remove, edit, or
reject material such as comments, commits, code, wiki edits, issues, and other
contributions that are not aligned to this Code of Conduct, or to ban
temporarily or permanently any contributor for other behaviors that they deem
inappropriate, threatening, offensive, or harmful.

## Enforcement (Consequences of Unacceptable Behavior)

Unacceptable behavior from any community member, including sponsors and those
with decision-making authority, will not be tolerated.

Anyone asked to stop unacceptable behavior is expected to comply immediately.

If a community member engages in unacceptable behavior, the community leaders
may take any action they deem appropriate, up to and including a temporary ban
or permanent expulsion from the community without warning (and without refund in
the case of a paid event).

Project maintainers who do not follow or enforce the Code of Conduct in good
faith may face temporary or permanent repercussions as determined by other
members of the community's leadership.

## Reporting Guidelines

If you are subject to or witness abusive, harassing, or otherwise unacceptable
behavior, believe someone is violating the code of conduct, or have any other
concerns, please notify a community leader as soon as possible.

> CONTACT_INFO_HERE

All reports and complaints will be reviewed and investigated and will result in
a response that is deemed necessary and appropriate to the circumstances.

**All reports will be kept confidential.** In some cases we may determine that a
public statement will need to be made. If that's the case, the identities of all
victims and reporters will remain confidential unless those individuals instruct
us otherwise. Further details of specific enforcement policies may be posted
separately.

If you believe anyone is in physical danger, please notify appropriate emergency
services first. If you are unsure what service or agency is appropriate to
contact, include this in your report and we will attempt to notify them.

In your report please include:

- Names (legal, nicknames, or pseudonyms) of any individuals involved.
  - If there were other witnesses besides you, please try to include them as
    well if appropriate.
- When and where the incident occurred. Please be as specific as possible.
- Your account of what occurred.
  - If there is a publicly available record (e.g. a mailing list archive or a
    public IRC logger) please include a link.
- Any extra context you believe existed for the incident.
- If you believe this incident is ongoing.
- Any other information you believe we should have.
- Your contact info for follow-up contact.

Understandably, there are some circumstances that would discourage victims and
witnesses from coming forward to report incidents. Whilst it is preferred that
the reporter is known to the response team for better handling, an incident
reported anonymously is **always** preferred to an incident not being reported
at all. 

> ANONYMOUS REPORTING METHODS HERE

### What happens after you file a report?

You will receive an email from the community's Code of Conduct response team
acknowledging receipt as soon as possible. The working group will immediately
meet to review the incident and determine:

- What happened.
- Whether this event constitutes a code of conduct violation.
- What kind of response is appropriate.

If this is determined to be an ongoing incident or a threat to physical safety,
the team's immediate priority will be to protect everyone involved. This means
we may delay an "official" response until we believe that the situation has
ended and that everyone is physically safe.

Once the team has a complete account of the events they will make a decision as
to how to respond. Responses may include:

- Nothing (if we determine no code of conduct violation occurred).
- A private reprimand from the Code of Conduct response team to the
  individual(s) involved.
- A public reprimand.
- An imposed vacation (i.e. asking someone to "take a week off" from a mailing
  list or IRC).
- A permanent or temporary ban from some or all community spaces (events,
  meetings, mailing lists, IRC, etc.)
- A request to engage in mediation and/or an accountability plan.
- An update to the code of conduct for a previously unforeseen circumstance.

We'll respond to the person who filed the report with either a resolution or an
explanation of why the situation is not yet resolved.

Once we've determined our final action, we'll contact the original reporter to
let them know what action (if any) we'll be taking. We'll take into account
feedback from the reporter on the appropriateness of our response, but our
response will be determined by what will be best for community safety.

Finally, the response team will make a generalised report on the situation to
the community. The board may choose to issue a public report of the incident or
take additional actions.

### Appealing the response

Only permanent resolutions (such as bans) may be appealed. To appeal a decision
of the working group, contact the following with your appeal and the response
team will review the case.

> CONTACT_INFO_HERE

Additionally, community organizers are available to help community members
engage with local law enforcement or to otherwise help those experiencing
unacceptable behavior feel safe. In the context of in-person events, organizers
will also provide escorts as desired by the person experiencing distress.

## Addressing Grievances

If you feel you have been falsely or unfairly accused of violating this Code of
Conduct, you should notify **GOVERNING_BODY** with a concise description of your
grievance. Your grievance will be handled in accordance with our existing
governing policies.

> LINK_TO_POLICY

> **NOTE:** Every organization's governing policies should dictate how you
> handle warnings and expulsions of community members. It is strongly
> recommended that you mention those policies here or in *Enforcement* and that
> you include a mechanism for addressing grievances.

## Scope

This Code of Conduct applies both within project spaces and in public spaces 
(in all community venues, both online and in-person) when an individual is
representing the project or its community, as well as one-on-one communications
pertaining to community business.

Examples of representing a project or community include using an official
project e-mail address, posting via an official social media account, or acting
as an appointed representative at an online or offline event. Representation of
a project may be further defined and clarified by project maintainers.

This code of conduct and its related procedures also applies to unacceptable
behavior occurring outside the scope of community activities when such behavior
has the potential to adversely affect the safety and well-being of community
members.
